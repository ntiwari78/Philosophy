## Key Themes from the Video

### 1 · The Intellectual Virtue: **Seek the Facts**

* Study any question by asking **“What are the facts, and what truth do they support?”**
* Do **not** be swayed by *wishful thinking* or hoped-for social consequences.

### 2 · The Moral Virtue: **Practice Tolerance**

* *“Love is wise, hatred is foolish.”*
* In an interconnected world, we must **tolerate** views we dislike and assume others argue in **good faith**.
* Civil disagreement sharpens philosophical understanding.

### 3 · Implications for This Course

| Take-away                | What It Means for You                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fact-centred inquiry** | Treat philosophical questions as rigorously as biology or mathematics. |
| **Openness to surprise** | Some conclusions may be unsettling—be ready to revise beliefs.         |
| **Respectful dialogue**  | Challenge arguments, not people; engage classmates’ ideas seriously.   |

## 1 St Anselm’s Argument

> **Key Thesis:** *God is “that than which nothing greater can be thought.”
> If such a being existed only in the understanding, a greater one could be
> conceived (namely, one that exists **in reality**). Therefore God exists
> both in thought and in reality.*

<a name="ch2"></a>

### Chapter 2 – That God Truly Exists

> > “Even the fool must admit that *something-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought*
> > exists **at least** in the understanding… But it cannot exist **only** in the
> > understanding, for then a greater (one that exists in reality) could be conceived…
> > Therefore it exists both in the understanding **and** in reality.”

<a name="ch3"></a>

### Chapter 3 – That He Cannot Be Thought Not to Exist

> > *“…This being exists so truly that it cannot be thought not to exist.”*
> > A being whose non-existence is unthinkable is greater than one whose
> > existence is contingent; hence God’s non-existence is inconceivable.

<a name="ch4"></a>

### Chapter 4 – How the Fool Said in His Heart What Cannot Be Thought

> > Distinguishes **uttering** the words “God does not exist” from **grasping**
> > their meaning.  One who truly understands the definition cannot coherently
> > deny God’s existence.

<a name="ch5"></a>

### Chapter 5 – God Is Whatever It Is *Better* to Be Than Not to Be

> > God, the *summum bonum*, exists **through Himself** (*aseity*) and embodies
> > every positive perfection (justice, truth, happiness, etc.).

<a name="gaunilo"></a>

## 2 Gaunilo’s Reply *on Behalf of the Fool*

> **Analogy of the “Lost Island”**
> A perfect, luxuriant island can be *conceived*; yet we would not
> accept that it therefore exists in reality.  Likewise, Gaunilo argues,
> Anselm has not shown that the *greatest conceivable being* must exist.

---

<a name="rejoinder"></a>

## 3 Anselm’s Rejoinder to Gaunilo

> Anselm counters that his inference applies **only** to a being whose
> greatness is *maximal in principle*—i.e., *“that than which nothing
> greater can be thought.”*  No merely contingent object (like a hypothetical
> island) satisfies that description; hence the parody fails.

## 1 · Anselm’s Core Claim

> **God is “a being than which nothing greater can be conceived.”**
> Such a being must exist **not only in the mind but also in reality**, for existence-in-reality is a perfection.

| Chapter                                        | Logical Steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **II — Truly There Is a God**                  | 1. Even the “fool” (cf. *Psalm 14:1*) can *conceive* the idea of the greatest conceivable being (GCB).<br>2. Existence *in reality* is greater than existence *in intellectu* alone.<br>3. If the GCB existed only in the mind, a greater (one existing in reality) could be conceived ⇒ contradiction.<br>**∴** GCB exists both in mind **and in fact**. |
| **III — God Cannot Be Conceived Not to Exist** | 4. A being whose non-existence is inconceivable is greater than one whose existence is contingent.<br>5. If GCB could be thought *not* to exist, it would not be the GCB.<br>**∴** God’s non-existence is logically impossible.                                                                                                                           |

## 2 · Gaunilo’s Reply (*“On Behalf of the Fool”*)

> Uses the **“Lost Island”** parody to challenge the inference from *conceivability* to *actual existence*.

* **Lost Island Argument**

  1. One can conceive of the most perfect, luxuriant island imaginable.
  2. By Anselm’s logic, that island must exist (since existing in reality is “greater”).
  3. Absurd ⇒ Anselm’s form of reasoning is invalid.

Gaunilo insists that **conceptual perfection ≠ ontological necessity**; understanding a description need not guarantee real instantiation.

## 3 · Anselm’s Rejoinder

| Section                               | Counter-point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **General Refutation**                | The ontological proof applies **only** to a being whose greatness is *maximal in principle* (i.e., not dependent on contingent properties). An island’s excellence is contingent and finite; God’s greatness is **necessary** and unlimited. |
| **Necessary Existence**               | Anything that can be conceived *not* to exist is not the GCB. Since the GCB is, by definition, non-contingent, its existence is logically necessary; therefore Gaunilo’s parody fails.                                                       |
| **Inconceivability of Non-Existence** | Whoever *truly* conceives the GCB conceives a being that cannot be thought not to exist; thus verbal denial entails misunderstanding, not genuine conception.                                                                                |

## 5 · Take-Away

Anselm’s **ontological argument** turns on the notion that *necessary existence* is a perfection and therefore contained in the very concept of God.
Gaunilo’s objection—while highlighting possible logical pitfalls—does not, according to Anselm, apply to contingent or finite objects, leaving the argument for **God’s necessary being** intact.

## 5 · What *Is* “God”?

| Issue                   | Quick Observation                                                                                   |

| **Artistic depictions** | Michelangelo’s *Creation of Adam* shows a bearded, white, older male—metaphorical, not literal.     |
| **Gendered language**   | Catholic Catechism: *“God is pure spirit… He is neither man nor woman.”*                            |
| **Race & nationality**  | E. M. Delafield’s joke: “Most Englishmen are convinced that God is an Englishman educated at Eton.” |
| **Temporality**         | Is God *inside* time (very old) or *outside* time (atemporal)? Philosophers disagree.               |
