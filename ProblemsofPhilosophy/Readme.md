## Key Themes from the Video

### 1 · The Intellectual Virtue: **Seek the Facts**

* Study any question by asking **“What are the facts, and what truth do they support?”**
* Do **not** be swayed by *wishful thinking* or hoped-for social consequences.

### 2 · The Moral Virtue: **Practice Tolerance**

* *“Love is wise, hatred is foolish.”*
* In an interconnected world, we must **tolerate** views we dislike and assume others argue in **good faith**.
* Civil disagreement sharpens philosophical understanding.

### 3 · Implications for This Course

| Take-away                | What It Means for You                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fact-centred inquiry** | Treat philosophical questions as rigorously as biology or mathematics. |
| **Openness to surprise** | Some conclusions may be unsettling—be ready to revise beliefs.         |
| **Respectful dialogue**  | Challenge arguments, not people; engage classmates’ ideas seriously.   |
