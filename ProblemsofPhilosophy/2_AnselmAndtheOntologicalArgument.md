# Lecture 2 · Part 2 — *Anselm & the Ontological Argument*

## 1 · Who Was St Anselm?

|              |                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Life**     | (1033 – 1109) Italian Benedictine monk → theologian → *Archbishop of Canterbury* |
| **Legacy**   | Canonised; declared a *Doctor of the Church*                                     |
| **Key Work** | *Proslogion* – first explicit **ontological argument** for God’s existence       |

## 2 · What Does **“Ontological”** Mean?

> **Ontology** = branch of metaphysics that studies **being** and the **categories of existence**.
> *Proslogion II* is labelled “ontological” because its *premises turn entirely on what it means to exist.*

---

## 3 · Defining “God” for the Argument

> **God** = an **absolutely perfect being** possessing:
>
> * **Omnibenevolence** (*all-loving*)
> * **Omniscience** (*all-knowing*)
> * **Omnipotence** (*all-powerful*)

### A Classic Puzzle: *The Paradox of Omnipotence*

> *Can an omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that He cannot lift it?*
> **Yes?** → then God cannot lift it (not omnipotent).
> **No?** → then there’s something God cannot do (also not omnipotent).
> *Resolving (or dissolving) this paradox is left as an exercise.*

## 4 · Anselm’s Two “Modes” of Existence

| Mode                             | Example                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In the Mind** (*conceptually*) | Hogwarts, mermaids, “the monster under the bed”                |
| **In Reality** (*extramental*)   | You, MIT, Neptune — plus unknown planets, undiscovered enzymes |

*Goal:* Move **God** from *“mind-only”* to *the intersection*: mind **and** reality.

## 5 · *Proslogion II* – Anselm’s Ontological Argument (simplified)

| Step   | Proposition                                                                                                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P1** | *God exists in the mind.* (We can conceive the GCB—*Greatest Conceivable Being*.)                          |
| **P2** | *Either* God exists only in the mind *or* both in mind **and** reality.                                    |
| **P3** | Existing in reality is **greater** than existing only in the mind; a *mind-only* GCB would not be perfect. |
| **P4** | *God is perfect* by definition.                                                                            |
| **C**  | ∴ God must exist **in reality** (as well as in the mind).                                                  |

> Anselm treats this as a *logical proof*—akin to a mathematical demonstration.

## 6 · Gaunilo’s “Lost Island” Objection

| Parallel Argument                                                                | Key Move             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1. **API** (*Absolutely Perfect Island*) exists in the mind.                     | We have the concept. |
| 2. It exists either **mind-only** or **mind + reality**.                         |                      |
| 3. To exist in reality is “more perfect” → a mind-only API would not be perfect. |                      |
| 4. But by definition, API **is** perfect.                                        |                      |
| **∴** A perfect island must exist in reality.                                    |                      |

Gaunilo says the conclusion is absurd → therefore Anselm’s reasoning *must* be flawed.

## 7 · Two Guiding Questions

1. **Do the arguments truly stand or fall together?**

   * Is there a *relevant disanalogy* between “perfect being” and “perfect island”?
2. **If they are parallel, *where* exactly is Anselm’s mistake?**

   * Identifying the faulty premise (or hidden assumption) is the next philosophical task.

*(The course invites you to grapple with these questions rather than giving a tidy answer.)*
